title: "Why Bloggy, and why React?"

Say look at the time it takes to read the bloggy. Now it might look it is so difficult to write that, there is no complex code logic, a simple demystification.

The coffee building machine:
```javascript
function formatCoffee(minutes) {
  let valueRounded = Math.ceil(minutes / 5);
  return new Array(valueRounded).fill('â˜•').join('');
}
```

Now that is not the reason behind bloggy, my main goal is for this blog is to me remembering the stuff that I learned while doing random things that I do.

## But Why Gatsby?

Well if you refer the website of them it says **Gatsby is a blazing fast modern site generator for React** believe me that those words are true because I'll always do benchmark tests on all my thingies that I develop.

## But Why React?

Just take a look at their website [Click here for React website](https://reactjs.org/) since it is component based you can always know what each and every component doing just by taking a look at their `state` and their `render` method, it is pretty and concise and easy to learn, and can be used on every place like even for building Mobile applications using React-Native.

## Who this blog is for?

To who this blog is for all who is really interested in learning about new technologies because as you might know I already said about me in the about section of the Bloggy.

## Why no graphics on the webpages?

This is a simple one I'm trying to do animations based upon Spring-physics rather than traditional time-based animations. I'm trying to build my own Spring-physics animations from scratch but it takes a lot of time because, it is just me madly typing on my keyboard hoping that the animation will be rendered in 60fps but no it takes a huge lag and lays down to 10fps so that it cannot render more than even 10 elements, so wait till I learn to do it correctly or wait till I get frustrated and use any other spring graphics library.

Now go ahead and try to build a blog on your own, and do share it with me!!
